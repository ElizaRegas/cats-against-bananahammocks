IN A WORLD where you can't get together with your friends to enjoy drinks, trash talk, and inappropriate card based humor, Cats Against Banana Trees sets a new paradigm. Using a combination of chat features and an interactive UI/UX, you can once again play all your favorite combinations that would make your parents blush.

## Description

Satisfy the itch to make your friends and family uncomfortable, all from the safety of your couch or toilet. Create your own clever username and join your game-mates in furious banter while selecting the best(?) answer for each round.

Cats Against Banana Trees (CABT) uses socket.io, sequelize, and express-handlebars to deliver a multiplayer online Cards Against Humanity&copy; style experience. Players are able to create their own unique username and then enter a game. During gameplay, socket.io enables both live chat and an interactive and real-time player ui.
